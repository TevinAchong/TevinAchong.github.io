Hey I'm Tevin Achong. In 2020 I graduated from the University of the West Indies with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm interested in exploring Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning in general.

## Some of the Work I've Done
- September 2020 - I co-authored the paper [*Automatic Extraction of Lexical Items in the Dictionary of English/Creole of Trinidad and Tobago*]() with [Dr. Phaedra Mohammed](http://phaedramohammed.com/), [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajeevratan/) and [Jimmel Greer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimmel-greer-62aba0151/). This paper has been submitted to EACL 2021, and we are currently awaiting feedback. 

- May 2020 - Along with my group members Jimmel Greer, and Ravindra Mangar (now an MS CS student at CU Boulder), we completed our final undergraduate project: [A Comparison of Natural Language Processing Models for the Task of Sentiment Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gbure62Sl1r3vttIjE-FU1dp6NHdrsYd/view?usp=sharing).

- August 2020 - Presented my poster as part of NASA Ames' poster symposium 2019. This poster was based on my work at NASA Ames: [Combining Satellite Imagery with Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for flood mapping using machine learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_hNzsV7t6udRzjrhu7FqRC1WB0cckyIm/view?usp=sharing).

- August 2020 - [Work at NASA Ames](http://niherst.gov.tt/files/NASA/Tevin_Achong_Final_Internship_Report_2019.pdf) published on NIHERST's website.
