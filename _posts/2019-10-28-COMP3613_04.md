We completed our first "sprint" during this period. Jimmel completed some tests for the React end of the application, while Quinton and Shawntel worked on setting up a Twitter developer account and pulling tweets from twitter given a query. 
My solo task was setting up the sentiment analysis tool, using Vader. 
I wrote a function which takes text input, and returns a classification (0: neutral, -1: negative, 1: positive).
All components of the application are still separate, however. 

Haven't had any problems working with my group to this point.
