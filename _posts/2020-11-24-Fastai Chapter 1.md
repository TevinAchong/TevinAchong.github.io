Here I answer (some of) the questions at the end of the first chapter of [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

1. **What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?**
  - 
2. **Based on the book of the same name, what are some of the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?**
  -
3. **What were two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?**
  -
4. **What is a GPU?**
  -
5. **Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?**
  -
6. **What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment?**
  -
7. **What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?**
  -
8. **Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?**
  -
9. **What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?**
  -
10. **What do you need in order to train a model?**

11. **How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?**
  -
12. **What is the difference between classification and regression?**
  -
13. **What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?**
  -
14. **Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?**
  -
15. **What is overfitting? Provide an example.**
  -
16. **What is a metric? How does it differ from loss?**
  -
17. **How can pretrained models help?**
  -
18. **What is the "head" of a model?**
