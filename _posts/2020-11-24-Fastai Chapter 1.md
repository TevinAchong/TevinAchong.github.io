Here I answer (some of) the questions at the end of the first chapter of [Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook).

1. **What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?**
  - The name of this device was the *Mark I Perceptron*. It was primarily developed by Mark Rosenblatt (when he expanded upon work done by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts). In "The Design of an Intelligent Automaton", Rosenblatt wrote about this work: "We are now about to witness the birth of such a machine - a machine capable of perceiving, recognizing and identifying its surroundings without any human training or control". It was able to successfully recognize simple shapes. 
  
2. **Based on the book of the same name, what are some of the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?**
  - A set of *processing units*
  - A state of *activation*
  - An *output function* for each unit
  - A *pattern of connectivity* among units
  - A *propogation rule* for propogating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities
  - An *activation rule* for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit
  - A *learning rule* whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience
  - An *environment* within which the system must operate
  Neural networks handle each of these requirements.
  
3. **What were two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?**
  -
4. **What is a GPU?**
  -
5. **Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?**
  -
6. **What did Samuel mean by "weight assignment?**
  -
7. **What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called "weights"?**
  -
8. **Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?**
  -
9. **What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?**
  -
10. **What do you need in order to train a model?**
  -
11. **How could a feedback loop impact the rollout of a predictive policing model?**
  -
12. **What is the difference between classification and regression?**
  -
13. **What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?**
  -
14. **Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?**
  -
15. **What is overfitting? Provide an example.**
  -
16. **What is a metric? How does it differ from loss?**
  -
17. **How can pretrained models help?**
  -
18. **What is the "head" of a model?**
  -
19. **What kinds of features do the early layers of a CNN find? How about the later layers?**
  -
20. **What is an architecture?**
  -
21. **What is segmentation?**
  -
22. **What are hyperparameters?**
