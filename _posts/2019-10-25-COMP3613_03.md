During this period, I was primarily focused on getting my group on-board with the choice of technologies, considering that they were changing so much and so rapidly. 
One other change that my team and I had to consider was the fact the application possibly did not require a typical database, as we do not necessarily intend to store any data. 
** Explanation: **
The application will be used as follows:
Users will visit the site, enter their search term (company name), and they will then be able to view the amounts of positive or negative tweets about that company.
So, essentially, the application will not need to store anything, thus we do not currently see the need for permanent storage.
