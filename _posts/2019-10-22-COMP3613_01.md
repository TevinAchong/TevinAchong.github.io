Our first SCRUM meeting was held last night via Whatsapp, with Jimmel Greer as the SCRUM master. 
**Key takeaways:**
1. Sprint 1: 14th - 17th October
   Sprint 2: 19th - 22nd October
   Sprint 3: 24th - 27th October
   Sprint 4: 29th - 1st October
   
2. Sprint 1 will consist of setting up the application to pull tweets from Twitter and hopefully performing analysis on the tweets.

3. NLTK will be used to do the sentiment analysis rather than Vader, requirements document needs to be revised.
