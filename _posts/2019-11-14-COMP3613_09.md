The other members of the group were foucsing on the frontend of the application, using React, while I was mainly focused on optimizing and setting up the sentiment analysis and modularizing the different components of it. 
So when I got the backend to a satisfactory level, we encoutered issues when trying to pass the necessary data to the frontend so that it could be displayed to the user. 
Since there is no database in use (discussed in earlier post), it is not just a matter of pulling from the DB and displaying on the frontend, we need to find a way to do everyhting in "realtime".
