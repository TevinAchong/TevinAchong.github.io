We held another SCRUM meeting today, with Quinton Thompson as the SCRUM master. He outlined the things up for discussion as:\n
1. What reports are generated by the sentiment analysis
2. What parts of the software we could code up before the next scrum meeting?
3. How will we be performing the presentations?
4. Any problems/thoughts on your minds?

At this point, I had personally began work on connecting the different components of the system. i.e. Using tweets pulled from the tweet puller component of the application as input to the sentiment analyser component of the application. Efforts were made, on the suggestion of the lecturer, to try to make the code as modular as possible. So I tried to achieve that, in order to ensure that future work does not have to result in too major a modification of the code in the application.
