After going through some of the documentation for NLTK, and running some examples, I realized that the performance was not exceptional. Accurate classifications were only being made on very clear and obvious text, such as "This movie is very good" or "United Airlines sucks". We soon discovered that this problem is present in most of the available libraries and toolkits. After discusisng it with the lecturer, he advised/suggested focusing on the software engineering process more than necessarily building a state-of-the-art application. 
As such, we have decided to use Vader to do the classifications as it has the simplest and most straightforward interface.
