Soooooo (probably) due to our inexperience with React, we decided to use a different technology Node.js and Express, much to the chagrin of my group members. Node was used to set up the server, and express to set up the routes and views. We had to use the npm module 'child_process' to execute the python script which returned the classifications of tweets. In short, this is how we were able to get access to the data in JavaScript. So we were able to allow the user to enter their query in the browser and have charts displayed to them.
