During this week, the majority of our efforts were spent deciding which technologies would be used to develop the application.
After some deliberation, our team decided on using ReactJS on the front-end of the application and Firebase to store data. 
We also confirmed what we would be using to capture the tweets and perform sentiment analysis.
The Twitter API will help us to retrieve tweets while a Python library called Vader will be used to perform sentiment analysis.
Vader is optimized to perform well on social-media-like text.
Project roles were also established, as well as the meeting schedule for the group.
Development is scheduled to start during this week. 

Expect frequent updates, and join me and the team in learning how to implement and integrate all these technologies.
